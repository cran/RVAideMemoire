\title{
Permutation Analysis of Variance
}
\description{
Performs a permutation analysis of variance for 1 to 3 factors. For 2 and 3 factors, experiment design must be balanced. For 2 factors, the factors can be crossed with or without interaction, or nested. The second factor can be a blocking (random) factor. For 3 factors, design is restricted to 2 fixed factors crossed (with or without interaction) inside blocks (third factor).
}
\usage{
perm.anova(formula, nest.f2 = c("fixed", "random"), data, nperm = 999,
  progress = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{formula}{
a formula of the form \code{response ~ factor(s)} (see Details).
}
  \item{nest.f2}{
in case of 2 nested factors, precision is needed if the nested factor (factor2) is \code{"fixed"} (default) or \code{"random"}.
}
  \item{data}{
an optional data frame containing the variables in the formula \code{formula}. By default the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}.
}
  \item{nperm}{
number of permutations.
}
  \item{progress}{
logical indicating if the progress bar should be displayed.
}
}
\details{
For 2 factors, the formula can be:

\code{response ~ factor1 + factor2} for 2 fixed factors without interaction

\code{response ~ factor1 * factor2} for 2 fixed factors with interaction

\code{response ~ factor1 / factor2} for 2 fixed factors with factor2 nested into factor1 (if factor2 is a random factor, argument \code{nest.f2} must be changed from \code{"fixed"} (default) to \code{"random"})

\code{response ~ factor1 | factor2} for 1 fixed factor (factor1) and 1 blocking (random) factor (factor2).

For 3 factors, the formula can only be:

\code{response ~ factor1 + factor2 | factor3} or

\code{response ~ factor1 * factor2 | factor3}. The 2 factors are here fixed and crossed inside each level of the third, blocking (random), factor.

The function deals with the limitted floating point precision, which can bias calculation of p-values based on a discrete test statistic distribution.
}
\value{
  a data frame of class \code{"anova"}.
