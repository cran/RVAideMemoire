\arguments{
  \item{x}{
  a multivariate analysis (see Details).
}
  \item{xax}{
  the horizontal axis.
}
  \item{yax}{
  the vertical axis. This can be set to \code{NULL} for a one-dimensional graph, which is a dotchart.
}
  \item{thresh}{
  threshold (in absolute value of the correlation coefficient) of variables to be plotted.
}
  \item{fac}{
  an optional factor defining groups of variables.
}
  \item{set}{
  variables to be displayed, when several sets are available (see Details). \code{12} (default) for both sets, \code{1} for X or constraints, \code{2} for Y or constrained variables.
}
  \item{space}{
  variables to be displayed, when several spaces are available (see Details). \code{space} is the number of the space to be plotted.
}
  \item{xlab}{
  legend of the horizontal axis. If \code{NULL} (default), automatic labels are used depending on the multivariate analysis.
}
  \item{ylab}{
  only used for two-dimensional graphs. Legend of the vertical axis. If \code{NULL} (default), automatic labels are used depending on the multivariate analysis.
}
  \item{main}{
  optional title of the graph.
}
  \item{circle}{
  only used for two-dimensional graphs. Logical indicating if the circle of radius 1 should be plotted.
}
  \item{intcircle}{
  only used for two-dimensional graphs. Vector of one or several values indicating radii of circles to be plotted inside the main circle. Can be set to \code{NULL}.
}
  \item{points}{

}
  \item{ident}{
  only used for two-dimensional graphs when \code{points=TRUE}. A logical indicating if variable names should be displayed.
}
  \item{arrows}{
  only used if \code{points=TRUE}. Logical indicating if arrows should be plotted. If \code{FALSE}, points are displayed at the extremity of the arrows.
}
  \item{labels}{

For two-dimensional graphs: if \code{fac} is not \code{NULL}, can be a vector of length one or a vector giving one value per group; otherwise a vector of any length can be defined, which is recycled if necessary. For dotcharts, gives the size used for points and all labels (see \code{\link{dotchart}}).
}
  \item{col}{
  color(s) used for points and/or variable names. If \code{fac} is not \code{NULL}, can be a vector of length one or a vector giving one value per group. Otherwise a vector of any length can be defined, which is recycled if necessary (not available for density histograms, see \code{dhist}).
}
  \item{lwd}{
  only used if arrows are displayed. Width of arrows. If \code{fac} is not \code{NULL}, can be a vector of length one or a vector giving one value per group. Otherwise a vector of any length can be defined, which is recycled if necessary.

This function should not be use directly. Prefer the general \code{\link[RVAideMemoire]{MVA.plot}}, to which all arguments can be passed.

Many multivariate analyses are supported, from various packages:

- PCA: \code{\link[ade4]{dudi.pca}}, \code{\link[vegan:cca]{rda}}.

- sPCA: \code{\link[mixOmics]{spca}}.

- IPCA: \code{\link[mixOmics]{ipca}}.

- sIPCA: \code{\link[mixOmics]{sipca}}.

- LDA: \code{\link[MASS]{lda}}, \code{\link[ade4]{discrimin}}.

- PLS-DA (PLS2 on a dummy-coded factor): \code{\link[mixOmics]{plsda}}. X space only.

- sPLS-DA (sPLS2 on a dummy-coded factor): \code{\link[mixOmics]{splsda}}. X space only.

- CPPLS: \code{\link[pls]{mvr}}. Set 1 is X, set 2 is Y. If \code{set=12} (default), \code{fac} is not available and \code{pch},\code{cex}, \code{col}, \code{lwd} can be defined differently for each set. X space only.

- PLSR: \code{\link[pls]{mvr}}, \code{\link[mixOmics]{pls}}, \code{plsR} (plsRglm package). Set 1 is X, set 2 is Y. If \code{set=12} (default), \code{fac} is not available and \code{pch},\code{cex}, \code{col}, \code{lwd} can be defined differently for each set. X space only.

- sPLSR: \code{\link[mixOmics]{pls}}. Set 1 is X, set 2 is Y. If \code{set=12} (default), \code{fac} is not available and \code{pch},\code{cex}, \code{col}, \code{lwd} can be defined differently for each set. X space only.
