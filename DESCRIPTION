Description: This package contains diverse more or less complicated
        functions, written to simplify beginners' (but not only) life:
        simplifications of existing functions, basic but not
        implemented tests, easy-to-use tools... All functions are
        presented in the French book 'Aide-memoire de statistique
        appliquee a la biologie', written by the same author and
        available on CRAN.
